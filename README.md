Write a simple program in C++ that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console.
Compile and run the program.
Expected Outcome: The student should understand how to write, compile, and run a basic C++ program.

Next Steps: In the next lessons, we will build upon the foundation laid in Lesson 1, starting with data types, variables, and basic input/output operations in C++.

Lesson 2: Data Types, Variables, and Input/Output

Objective: To teach the student about different data types in C++ and how to use variables and input/output operations.

Project: "Calculator"

Instructions:

Write a program in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers entered by the user.
Use appropriate data types for the numbers and result.
Use variables to store the numbers and the result.
Use input/output operations to read the numbers from the user and display the result.
Expected Outcome: The student should understand how to declare variables, use data types, and perform basic input/output operations in C++.

Next Steps: In the next lessons, we will cover more advanced topics such as loops, decision-making statements, and functions.

---

Lesson 3: Control Flow: Loops and Conditional Statements

Objective: To teach the student how to use loops and conditional statements to control the flow of a program.

Project: "Guess the Number"

Instructions:

Write a program in C++ that generates a random number and allows the user to guess it.
Use loops to repeatedly prompt the user for a guess until they enter the correct number.
Use conditional statements to give feedback to the user, such as "Too high," "Too low," or "Correct!"
Keep track of the number of guesses the user has made and display it after the correct answer is entered.
Expected Outcome: The student should understand how to use loops and conditional statements to control the flow of a program and to implement basic game logic.

Next Steps: In the next lessons, we will cover more advanced topics such as arrays, pointers, and structures.

---

Lesson 4: Arrays, Pointers, and Structures

Objective: To teach the student about arrays, pointers, and structures in C++ and how to use them.

Project: "Student Management System"

Instructions:

Write a program in C++ that keeps track of student information such as name, ID, and grades.
Use an array of structures to store the information for multiple students.
Use pointers to dynamically allocate memory for the structures and the array.
Implement functions to add a student, delete a student, and display the information for all students.
Expected Outcome: The student should understand how to use arrays, pointers, and structures in C++ and how to implement basic database operations.

Next Steps: In the next lessons, we will cover more advanced topics such as file handling, object-oriented programming, and template metaprogramming.

---

Lesson 5: File Handling and Exception Handling

Objective: To teach the student about file handling and exception handling in C++ and how to use them.

Project: "Movie Database"

Instructions:

Write a program in C++ that keeps track of movie information such as title, director, and release date.
Use file handling to read and write the information from and to a file.
Use exception handling to handle errors that may occur while reading or writing the file.
Implement functions to add a movie, delete a movie, and display the information for all movies.
Expected Outcome: The student should understand how to use file handling and exception handling in C++ and how to implement basic file I/O operations.

Next Steps: In the next lessons, we will cover more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming and design patterns.

---

Lesson 6: Object-Oriented Programming

Objective: To teach the student about object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++ and how to use it.

Project: "Bank Account System"

Instructions:

Write a program in C++ that implements a basic bank account system.
Use OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism to design and implement the system.
Implement classes for different types of accounts, such as savings, checking, and credit, with appropriate properties and methods.
Use inheritance to reuse code and to model the relationships between different types of accounts.
Use polymorphism to implement generic operations such as deposit and withdrawal that work for all types of accounts.
Expected Outcome: The student should understand how to use OOP in C++ and how to design and implement a basic bank account system.

Next Steps: In the next lessons, we will cover more advanced topics such as design patterns, software architecture, and software testing.

---

Lesson 7: Design Patterns and Software Architecture

Objective: To teach the student about design patterns and software architecture in C++ and how to use them.

Project: "Online Shopping System"

Instructions:

Write a program in C++ that implements an online shopping system.
Use design patterns, such as factory, decorator, and observer, to design and implement the system.
Use software architecture principles, such as modularity, separation of concerns, and loose coupling, to design and implement the system.
Implement the system in a way that allows for easy maintenance, extension, and testing.
Use appropriate data structures, such as lists, maps, and trees, to implement the core functionality of the system.
Expected Outcome: The student should understand how to use design patterns and software architecture in C++ and how to design and implement an online shopping system.

Next Steps: In the next lessons, we will cover more advanced topics such as software testing, deployment, and maintenance.

---

Lesson 8: Software Testing and Deployment

Objective: To teach the student about software testing and deployment in C++ and how to use them.

Project: "Weather Forecast System"

Instructions:

Write a program in C++ that implements a weather forecast system.
Use software testing techniques, such as unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing, to test the system.
Use a testing framework, such as Google Test or Catch2, to automate the testing process.
Use appropriate data structures, such as arrays, lists, and maps, to store and process the weather data.
Deploy the system on a cloud platform, such as AWS or Google Cloud, and make it accessible through a web API.
Expected Outcome: The student should understand how to use software testing and deployment in C++ and how to design and implement a weather forecast system.

Next Steps: In the final lesson, we will cover advanced topics such as optimization, performance tuning, and security.
